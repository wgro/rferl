# Ruby is a friendly programming language that's all the rage these days.
# It is easy to understand, and has a great community to help you when you get stuck.

# Let's start with the basics.

# 1 - Assigning variables.
# Variables store stuff by name. I've stored "Wojtek" in the variable my_name:

my_name = "Wojtek"

# I'll print the variable to the screen now:

puts my_name

# You can perform tons of operations on variables:

greeting = "Hello "

# Here I'm 'adding' my name to a greeting:

puts greeting + my_name

# Here I'm doing the same but with numbers:

x = 10
y = 5

puts x + y

# I can also compare stuff, using the equality operator, ==

your_name = "Jethroe"

puts your_name == my_name

# And compare sizes using the < and > operators.
# Using <= and >= is like saying 'less/greater than or equal to'

6 < 7 # true

6 < 9 # false

6 < 6 # false

6 <= 6 # true

# You can also evaluate inequality:

6 != 7 # true
