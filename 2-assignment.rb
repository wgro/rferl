# 1. Write an if/else statement that compares the number of free seats
#    to how many people there are. If there are not enough seats, print
#    "Overbooked!" otherwise print "Good to go!".

seats = 10
people = 11

# 2. Go through each element in this array and multiply it by 3.

numbers = [ 33, 29.77, 11, "42" ]

# 3. Now see if you can count the number of elements in that array.



# 4. Make a while loop that counts down from 99 and sings the beer song.
#    I've given you a bit of a start:

bottles = 99

# Beer song:
# puts "#{bottles} bottles of beer on the wall."
# puts "#{bottles} bottles of beer!"
# (You'll have a little bit of code to write on this line)
# puts "Take one down, pass it around, #{bottles} bottles of beer on the wall!"
